BashBot-KDE 🐧💻🎉

Meet  **BashBot-KDE** , your Linux buddy who talks *only* in bash commands wrapped in JSON, runs them one by one, and if it messes up, cries to the AI and tries again. It has zero memory (bless its little bot heart) but somehow manages to get stuff done. Kind of like you, but less coffee-dependent.

## What it does (kinda awesome stuff)

* 🐢 Breaks down your wild Linux dreams into tiny bash commands
* ✔️ Runs each command and double-checks it didn’t totally wreck your system
* 🛠️ If a command fails, cries for help, gets fixed, and tries again
* 🤖 Talks only in strict JSON, so your scripts can easily understand it
* 🧠 Has no memory, so it forgets everything immediately — fresh start every time

## Why you want it

* Automate your setup without losing your mind
* Fix your broken configs while you binge-watch something
* Run complicated bash tasks without typing every step
* Look like a Linux wizard without actually knowing what you’re doing

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo like a pro
2. Stick your Gemini API key in a `.env` file (don’t lose it, or BashBot gets sad)
3. Run BashBot and type what you want done in plain English
4. Watch it break your requests into tiny commands and fix mistakes like a champ

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+ (no dinosaurs allowed)
* `pyyaml` and `jinja2` (the magic sauce)
* Gemini API key or any LLM that plays nice with Model Context Protocol

## Future steps (because BashBot isn’t perfect yet)

* 🙋‍♂️ Add **user verification** so you don’t accidentally delete your life
* 🎨 Build a slick **KDE plasmoid UI** that sits pretty on your dock
* 📚 Teach BashBot some memory so it can remember your favorite tricks
* 🤖 Expand support to other LLMs and APIs because variety is life
